There is no beat, no melody. Burr, my first friend, my enemy, maybe the last face I ever get to see.\nIf I throw away my shot, is this how you'll remember me? What if this bullet is my legacy?\n\nLegacy. What is a legacy?\nIt's planting seeds in a garden you never get to see. I wrote some notes at the beginning of a song someone will sing for me. America, you great unfinished symphony, you sent for me.\nYou let me make a difference. A place where even orphan immigrants can leave their fingerprints and rise up. I'm running out of time. I'm running, and my time's up.\nWise up. Eyes up.\n\nI catch a glimpse of the other side. Laurens leads a soldiers' chorus on the other side. My son is on the other side. He's with my mother on the other side. Washington is watching from the other side\n\nTeach me how to say goodbye. Rise up, rise up, rise up, Eliza.\n\nMy love, take your time. I'll see you on the other side.\n\nRaise a glass to freedom...",
